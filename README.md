## <span style="color:#111">⚡ What I Built</span>

During the internship, I developed a complete Streamlit-based app with the following features:

* 🔍 Real-time employee salary prediction using multiple ML models
* 📄 Resume upload feature that auto-fills prediction fields
* 🧼 Complete preprocessing pipeline (cleaning, encoding, etc.)
* 📊 Interactive data dashboards for exploring insights
* 🔍 SHAP explainability for feature importance
* 📉 Residual plots, error analysis, and prediction distributions
* 📈 Model evaluation using R², RMSE, MAE, and CV
* 🗓 Trend charts and time-based analysis if date data is present
* 📊 Advanced statistical charts (Box, Violin, Outliers)
* 🧪 T-tests, correlation heatmaps, and hypothesis testing
* 📅 PDF report generation with predicted salary
